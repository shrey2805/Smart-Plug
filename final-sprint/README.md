# Final Sprint

### Sprint Catalog

The final items in the product backlog are:
- Start gathering data from Particle and processing it on Microsoft Azure.
- Making an dashboard for data visualization. 
- Making a mobile app and/or webite for loggin into the particle and setting up the deivce. 

But because of the time constraint, I will only work on uploading the data to Microsoft azure and building a dashboard for data visualization. Making an app or website are last on the priority list. 

### Outcome 

The final outcome of the project was a smart plug that works on the commands of Siri. 
Functionality to learn from the user behavior and nudge the user to take an action when the user is consuming more energy that usual by making the neopixel glow red was successfully implemented.  
Also, the dashbord for data visualization was achieved using Microsoft Azure. 
However, I was not able to explore the Azure for data modelling and machine learning algorithms. 

### Product Review  

[At the end of the development Inspect where the project is: Give a high level summary of what work was undertaken during this sprint, what was built and what stage it's at. ]

### Product Retrospective 

Following the agile process was very valuable for this course. I got to implement the lean methodology and one of the key things that I have learned is defining the scope of the sprint and not deviating from it during the sprint. 
I was successfully able to achive the basic MVP and hardware module because of previous experince in these things, but I struggled a lot with working with calibrating the sensor because of the limited documentation available for particle and Azure for data analysis. Making a website was out of scope because of the time constraint.

### Future Work

After realising the basic MVP and develooping a greater understanding of the IoT framework, I would like to explore the following areas of IoT: 
- How to use data to derive insights about user behavior
- Modelling the data to understand the routine and trying to build an automatic functionality
- Training a machine learning alogrithm and implementing device profiling
- Making a web or mobile application to set up the device
- Applying NFC to directly get redirected to the dashboard 
- Making a mesh network of particles and trying to integrate them to make a mock ecosystem
