# Final Sprint
## Usability Findings

_Prompt: Complete a heuristic evaluation or cognitive jogthrough (a quick and dirty usability evaluation with a small number of users) and report on your findings._

### Summary

A foam core model was presented to the users in the final sprint. 
I conducted user research on the functionality of the smart plug. The users were quiet impressed by the fact that the plug can be operated using voice commands with Siri.

Also, users were curious about what happened with the neo pixel ring.

### Findings

The neopixel foodback was a good addition and it brings value to the device, but the users initially got confused about it's behavior. 
It is important to tell the users in advance that the plug takes some number of tries before it is able to predict the behavior, and what is the meaning of each color.  

I included a button to operate the plug using a switch as well, but because it was a foam core model, users were nervous and avoided to interact with it. 

### Relevance

I got to learn that it is imporatnt to convey very specific information to the users at specific times so that they do not feel anxious. 
The human factors became more important as I moved towards the final itearations in the course. Also, the kind of feedback that I got was different in each sprint, depending on how was the prototype was looking. 
In the further iterations, it is required to make a robust prototype that users can easilty interact with. Also conveying the scenario with relevant visuals is very important to get quality feedback.
