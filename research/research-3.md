# Research Sprint 3
## Connectivity and Preferences Research

_Prompt: Identify 3-5 opportunities around connectivity, networking or user preferences that would enhance your application and that you could potentially integrate_

In this sprint, objective is to start getting data from the particle directly to a cloud platform for data visualization. 
For this, particle has a tool called "integrations" that can be used to connected to services like Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Webhooks etc.

### Summary

I was looking for a web based service which can be used as an IoT hub for relaying data analysing it to perform behavior modelling.  

### Findings

I used 2 web integrations i.e. Azure and ThingSpeak 
Thingspeak is a free service which can be used to data visualization, however there is very less flexibility of wat you can do with the data collected compared to Azure. 
Azure is an industrial tool that where in one can buit machine learning models and use the platform as a virtual machine.
Also, azure provided real time data and has very less latency which was ideal for my use. 

### Relevance

Using Azure, I was able to make an online dashboard where the energy consumption data can be visualized in a form of a line chart. 
Also, Azure has enabled me to explore areas like device profiling and making prediction models about behavior consumption which is part of future work.
