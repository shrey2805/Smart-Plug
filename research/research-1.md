# Research Sprint 1
## Behaviour / Product Research

_Prompt: Identify 3-5 similar products or projects that you can draw inspiration from or use to inform the design (technical or interaction) of your work_

There are a lot of precedents of the work that I am trying to do. My objective to maximise my learning and spend least time on uncertainity. 

Following are some examples:
- Amazon Alexa Smart Plug: https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Plug-works-Alexa/dp/B01MZEEFNX/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=smart+plug&qid=1579806143&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFSzlKQTUxWkdUQzcmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAyOTY1MzExMlNSREVRNE9SUktHJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzMTM5ODcxQjcxUDJNVDRDSFBWJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

  - The final product migh work very closely like this device works. 

- Hackster smart plug project : https://www.hackster.io/daniel0524/building-a-wifi-outlet-cf3d0c
  - This project was done with an older version of the particle framework. A lot of problems that have been suggested in this project have been already addressed. However, this was one of first places where I derive inspiration from. 

- Adafruit controllable 4 power outlet relay: https://www.adafruit.com/product/2935?gclid=CjwKCAiA35rxBRAWEiwADqB37xAreFrviDzaaewke07-gsZXQ3JsDldHsHa9HAejgqoVOoEd6KkKgxoC2GAQAvD_BwE 
  - This is a hardware module that I found which perfectly suits my needs. After I found this, I was sure that I was going to proceed with this project. 

### Summary

[Give a high level overview of how you approached the research - what were you looking for]
I decided to work on this project because I wanted to explore the complete built cycle of an typical IoT product. There are 3 critical things that I want myself to become confortable with. 
- Connecting my device to pre-existing IoT infrastructure - Alexa, Siri, Google home etc. 
- Deepen my understanding about the electronics and custom hardware and work with the 120V AC current input. 
- Build an interface that the user has to interact with to setup the device. 
I wanted to choose a model project to develop a higher level understanding of all these moving components. Also, I wanted to buy a smart plug, so I decided to build it. 

Also, I think it is wise to start small and built additional functionality as I proceed instead of starting big with a lot of moving parts and then cutting down on features/functionality. 

### Findings

[Give a summary of your findings and the examples you found]
The first impression of the project was that it should be really simple, but as I started to dig in deeper, I realised that there were enough moving parts and that the project is well scoped. I have enough precedents to take inspiration from and there are a ton of resources on the web which would help me to explore and deepen my understanding of the IoT framework.  

### Relevance

[How does it inform what you're about to build/what did you learn?]
